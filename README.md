# Image-regression-to-predict-percent-recovery-of-fruits-using-autokeras

This code loads images of jackfruits along with their corresponding mass information from a directory and a CSV file. The mass values are normalized and the data is split into training and validation sets using the train_test_split() function from the sklearn.model_selection library. An Image Regressor from the AutoKeras library is then initialized and the model is fitted with the dataset, labels, and a time limit of 126060 seconds. Finally, the model is evaluated on test data and the test loss and test accuracy are printed. The code also includes some comments explaining what each section does and mentions that the user may need to adjust the code depending on how their data is organized and how they want to set the parameters for the model.
